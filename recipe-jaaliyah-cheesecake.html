                <p> Cheesecake is simply the best dessert hands down. It contains simple ingredients and you can eat it
                    plain or spice it up a bit by adding anything your heart desires.</p>
                <p>Normally baking cheesecake at home requires the addition of a water bath which can be a hassle. This
                    recipe instead is cooked on a low temperature which makes the perfect cheecake every time! </p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 325F</li>
                    <li>Prepare graham cracker crust by mixing dry ingredients and stirring well. Add melted butter and
                        use fork to combine.</li>
                    <li>Pour crumbs into 9" Springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of your
                        pan. Set aside.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Cheesecake</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir
                        until smooth and creamy (don’t over-beat or you’ll incorporate too much air).</li>
                    <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
                    <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer,
                        make sure you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so
                        that all ingredients are evenly incorporated.</li>
                    <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until
                        each egg is just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides
                        and bottom of the bowl again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.</li>
                    <li>Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a
                        cookie sheet that’s been lined with foil.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for about 75 minutes. Edges
                        will likely have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the
                        center should spring back to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the
                        texture will suffer, which means we all suffer.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven³ for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has
                        passed, use a knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will
                        help prevent cracks as your cheesecake cools and shrinks). Do not remove the ring of the
                        springform pan.</li>
                    <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to
                        refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. I remove the ring of the
                        springform pan just before serving then return it to the pan to store. Enjoy!</li>

                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <p>Make sure that you use the brick-style cream cheese, not the spreadable version that is available in
                    tubs.</p>
                <p>I recommend the top of the oven because it is usually the warmest place in my house (after it’s been
                    on for over an hour). This will help to cool the cheesecake more gradually and will also help avoid
                    cracks).</p>
